## üèõÔ∏è SILA ‚Äì Backend (API & Data Infrastructure)

The **SILA Backend** powers the unified charity data ecosystem by providing secure APIs, role-based authentication, and integrated data management for **Charities**, **Beneficiaries**, and **Program-Owner Ministries**.  
It enables transparent collaboration between the **Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSD)** ‚Äî the superuser authority ‚Äî and other **ministries** responsible for specific programs (e.g., *Sakani* by the Ministry of Housing, *Takaful* by the Ministry of Education).
